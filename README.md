# ATS-Resume-LLM-App
This is a Streamlit-based application that evaluates resumes based on a given job description (JD) using Google's Gemini-Pro language model. The app acts like an Application Tracking System (ATS), offering insights into resume improvements by identifying matching percentages, missing keywords, and generating a profile summary.
